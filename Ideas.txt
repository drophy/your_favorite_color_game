Ideas:
> Make it adapt better to different screen sizes
> Consider adding complementary color in first 3 stages
> Consider showing a somewhat transparent text with the hex/rgb color when a square is hovered over
> Register the users previous choices and display them somewhere?
> Consider allowing the user to change the h1's text and color (so they can see how their color works
> Consider adding a light mode (rn it's in "night mode" I guess)
